MOS was created by `James Merrick <http://stanford.edu/~jmerrick/>`_ and `Tomás Tinoco De Rubira <https://ttinoco.github.io/>`_. 

Tomás and James were inspired to build MOS after the friction they experienced in deploying optimization solutions to real world problems.

Tomás and James earned their PhDs from Stanford University, developing tractable formulations of important optimization problems.
