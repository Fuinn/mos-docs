Using the Service
=================

There are three ways to use MOS:

1. **MOS demo**: This is a simple way to run MOS locally on your machine to try the service. It runs all MOS components in `docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ images using `docker-compose <https://www.docker.com/>`_. It uses development servers NOT suitable for production-grade applications needing performance and security. It is just for demo purposes. Instructions for launching the demo can be found `here <https://github.com/Fuinn/mos-demo>`_. 

2. **MOS cloud**: Access and use MOS hosted on the cloud with performance and security features. (Coming soon)

3. **MOS on-premise**: Deploy MOS on a private network and servers by working directly with the :ref:`code repositories <resources_code>`.
