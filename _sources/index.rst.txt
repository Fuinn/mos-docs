MOS
===============================

This is the documentation for MOS, the *Mathematical Optimization Service*.

`MOS <https://fuinn.ie/mos.pdf>`_ facilitates the deployment, integration, management and
utilization of mathematical optimization models. MOS makes it easier
for both humans and machines to harness the power of mathematical optimization.

Models may be accessed and solved directly through the MOS :ref:`api`,
or the REST API may be called indirectly through the MOS Interface
`Python package <https://github.com/Fuinn/mos-interface-py>`_ or
`Julia package <https://github.com/Fuinn/mos-interface-jl>`_,
or through the `MOS Frontend <https://github.com/Fuinn/mos-frontend>`_.

Either a user's
own models and data may be uploaded to MOS, or models and data chosen from the
`MOS Examples repository <https://github.com/Fuinn/mos-examples>`_.
